I wouldn\u0027t be opposed to changing the dist rules to be opt-in instead of requiring owners. Don\u0027t care a huge amount though.",

      "message": "I think the confusion here is that java_sdk_library is overloading the \"owner\" field to mean \"what directory should the SDK be installed in during finalization\", specifically to answer the question \"should this be part of the android SDK during finalization\".\n\nMaybe it would be better to give java_sdk_library a new property to specify that directory, rather than reusing a property that already means \"who owns this code\"?",

      "message": "So, the issue is that java_sdk_library automatically adds itself to the dist in hard coded directories and we need to be able to have some control over that.\n\nI\u0027m not 100% sure of the effect of setting the owner property but given that Colin thinks \"overloading\" it in this way is causing confusion it may be better to add a different dist specific property.\n\nThere is already a no_dist property and a dist_stem property to control some aspects of the dist instructions. So, adding more dist specific properties (rather than the more generic owner property) has precedence.",
